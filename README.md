### An interface for the refrigerator with various functions of adding an item to the refrigerator, removing, preparing for shopping and more....
### The interface presents the user with a navigation menu
And the user will be able to do any action he wants by entering the desired number...

#### Another example: getting ready to go shopping
The software checks whether there is at least 20 square meters free - there was no room here and he threw away one expired product as well as 3 other products with different capabilities that will expire in a few days and now he can go shopping
